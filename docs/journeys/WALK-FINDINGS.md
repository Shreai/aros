# Walk findings — where the current build breaks the golden journeys

Grounded gaps between the journey contracts in this folder and the shipped
code, from a code-level walk + a live seam walk of app.aros.live
(2026-07-17). Each maps to a spec + step with file refs. Fix these before
calling the journey done; delete entries as they close (this file trends to
empty).

*(J1/J2 `/start` force-demo finding CLOSED 2026-07-17: the journey contract
resolves it — sample data is for tenants with NO connector, labeled and
expected. `/start` now checks the tenant's store state first and redirects
already-connected tenants into the setup journey (`/onboarding`) instead of
ever showing them the sample store; brand-new tenants keep the labeled demo
surface by design. Earlier same day: the `/v1/demo/activation` 404 was
restored via shreai#1007/#1012.)*

*(Demo-chat $0.00 finding CLOSED 2026-07-17 — shreai#1020 + the public `/v1`
cutover (aros#85/#86), persona-walk verified. Its residual psql debt CLOSED
2026-07-17 by shreai#1028: every forge-*-tools.ts runSql shell-out migrated
to the async pg client (#968/#991 pattern), killing both the runtime failure
and the PGPASSWORD/argv leak — verified 2026-07-21, no execSync-psql paths
remain in shreai services.)*

## J2 steps 4–5 — readiness state machine pending activation-contract merge

Fixed so far: in-flight "Checking with <provider>…"; success copy scoped
honestly per provider; the KPI mapping drift that prevented real numbers
from EVER rendering; "live from <source>" marker; four honest Home states
via `hasConnector` + `summaryCapable`; and connect success now echoes a
recognizable live detail ("we found <store>: N transactions today") from
`/api/connectors/test`. Remaining:

- The full readiness state machine (`store_connector_bindings.status`,
  `tenant_app_activation_status`: `waiting_for_store → syncing → ready →
  attention`) lives on the **unmerged activation-contract branch** (chat
  data-wiring session). When it merges, replace the connector-row heuristic
  behind `hasConnector`/`summaryCapable` with the real binding states.

*(Inventory finding CLOSED 2026-07-17 via #90, live-verified: the catalog is
`GET /api/Item` — mapped with `iteM_InStock`/`iteM_MinStockLevel`/
`description`, deleted/inactive filtered, thresholds must be >0. Live
summary for the real store now reads `partial:false, lowStock
available:true, count:1` — "1000 STORIES CAB." 0/2, a genuine reorder item.
This followed the #88 closure of the partial-poisoning finding; PR #18
closed superseded with credit.)*

## Structural — connect UIs share one provider catalogue; step flows still differ

Provider/field definitions are consolidated in `lib/posProviders.ts` (single
source of truth for both `/connect` and the `ConnectWizard`, incl. hints and
wire types), and the wizard now reports the REAL test outcome (failed API
test keeps the wizard open; unconfirmable tunnel says "saved — couldn't
confirm yet" instead of claiming success). Remaining: the two surfaces still
render separate step flows (page = single form; wizard = 4 steps with SCOPE/
REVIEW) — acceptable while both consume the shared catalogue, revisit if
either grows another step.

## Tooling — browser E2E runner exists; deepest live step still manual

`pnpm e2e` (Playwright) now runs: public J1 seams + draft-safety + fail-closed
checks locally against the real frontend with mocked `/api/*` (no backend, no
seeded state), and a live J2 spec against a deployed surface when
`E2E_BASE_URL`/`E2E_EMAIL`/`E2E_PASSWORD` are set. Still manual: the deepest
J2 step (a real POS connect) needs test-store credentials — until then it's
the `journey-walker` subagent's job on beta.
