# AROS Platform Changelog

All notable changes to AROS Platform are documented here.
Follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Added context-aware Marketplace navigation from Apps, Connectors, Plugins, Skills, and Agents.
- Standardized spacing between page search controls and installed-resource content.
- Store connection management now supports title, details, access mode, provider configuration, and secure credential rotation with automatic re-testing.

### Planned / In Progress
- Verify the post-flip security checks now that the redesign is the default: server-side rejects a mismatched `x-aros-tenant-id`, `Cache-Control: private, no-store` on the app shell, demo-leak checks (login shows empty states / no demo persona)
- Converge the redesign canvas onto the shared `mib-widget` content-block contract (once the live fork picks up PR #38)
- Restyle the Login/Signup auth screens to the new theme
- MIB API reuse for resources/POS (blocked on a shre-id tenant↔company token bridge)
- Shre brain sync integration; BYOM model selector; Licensing module

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-16 — Chat-first redesign (soft launch)
### Added
- Chat-first "Command Home" redesign — warm Stripe/Apple theme (light/dark), gated behind `?redesign=1` (OFF by default; old dashboard unchanged).
- Home ⇄ chat slide; conversation canvas with Canvas/History tabs; 4-step Connect-a-register wizard (RapidRMS + Verifone).
- Left-panel profile (role + workspace nav), whitelabel branding module, responsive (mobile/tablet), consistent docked sidebar.
- Live data wiring: `/api/connectors`, `/api/resources/*`, `/api/dashboard`, `/api/store/summary`, `/api/billing/status`. Demo persona/figures render ONLY when unauthenticated (`/preview/app`) — never in a live session.
### Notes
- Deployed to production on 2026-07-16, reconciled onto the hand-managed VPS live fork (`live/direct-deploy`), not a main-based build. Initially gated behind `?redesign=1`; a concurrent workstream then **flipped it to the default** authenticated experience (legacy opt-out via `?redesign=0` → `aros-shell-legacy`) and added working sign-out + session-establishment fixes (`8e7551a`, `e3d3e7b`, `fe77441`). Per-browser rollback to the legacy UI: `?redesign=0`.
